God Ganesh, the god of all virtues and to whom the spirit owes its origin; Goddess Sharda, the goddess of speech; we bow to them. Now we will explore the way to reach Lord which is considered as infinite. 
Let us follow the path of honesty and devotion. This path will lead us to Shri Hari. Let us shun everything that is condemned and do everything that is commendable with the full devotion of mind. 
Let us remember Lord every morning. Let us start all our work by chanting Shri Ram. Let us always stick to the good behaviour. Only the person of good action is held in esteem in this world. 
Our evil desires are of no use. Sinful thoughts should not come to our mind. We should always have ethics. We should always know the real truth in our mind. 
Let us shun all sinful plans. Let us work on the plan that will lead us to the truth. Let us not always think about sensual pleasures. If our mind gets corrupted then we lose our reputation amidst people. 
Let us say no to anger which makes us feel sorry. Let us not corrupt our mind with all sorts of desires. Let us shun the doership of actions. Let us not praise ourselves due to the jealousy for others. 
Let us have great patience. Let us bear the evil words spoken to us. Let us always speak politely. Let us always understand others. 
Let us do something so that our good name remains even after perishing of our body. Let us do all good actions honestly. Let us wear out like sandalwood. Let others receive benefit out of our sufferings. 
Let us not keep an eye on others money. Selfishness adds to our sins. Let us avoid actions that will lead to incurring sin. We will always feel sad if we have lot of expectations. 
Let us always have love for Rama. Let us remove sadness from mind. We should learn to consider the sufferings that our body undergoes for good cause as happiness. We should always have knowledge of our true self in our mind. 
Who in this world is happy in all respects. Let us think over it. Whatever we have accumulated through our past actions, we have to suffer on that account. 
We should not bleed our mind with sorrow. We should not be engrossed with sadness and worries. We should discover our true self and should understand that our existence is not restricted to our body alone. Our existence is beyond our body and free from all shackles. 
See what happened to Ravana. He lost the whole kingdom all of a sudden. Therefore let us shun evil desires. Let us know that the death will consume us in the course of time. 
All beings of this world take birth and lose life. Even the greatest ones cannot escape from death. Many have born and died. 
If seen properly we can see that everyone on this earth has to die. But still people magnify their ego. People think that they wont die and they will live forever. But all of a sudden everything is gone. 
People feel sad about death of their dear ones. They are themselves heading to death. Greed makes one angry. Greed also pushes one into the cycle of death and rebirth. 
People keep their minds full of sorrows and worries. But the thing, that has to happen, happens suddenly. We should renounce the doership in everything that happens. A person who can not understand feels sad about the happenings. 
We should always long for Lord. We should not magnify our ego. Lord is described by the Vedas and the Puranas. After describing Lord nothing more needs to be described. 
We should never be away from the truth. We should not concieve anything without base. We should speak the truth and shun the baseless. 
If we are trapped in the cycle of death and rebirth then we have to undergo great hardships. 
Let us keep the desires at a distance. Let us not disturb the tranquility of mind. Let us renounce the cravings for wealth and wife. Constantly changing the state of mind results in agony. Let us reach out to Lord by adhering to the path he has shown.
Let us do good to ourselves. Let us install firmly personality of Lord in the mind. Lord is the master of Hanuman, the son of the Wind God. He can grant salvation to all the three worlds. 
Let us speak the truth. Speaking other than truth will not lead to happiness. The life is ending continuously by the passing of time. What can we do once the life is over? 
Let us not put ourselves to trouble by forgetting Lord. Let us not speak rubbish. Let us speak the truth. Let the sin in the form of ego be kept away from our mind.
Dont get fed up by speaking the truth. Otherwise how You can unite with Lord? You want to enjoy the present moment. Think what remains thereafter.
You dont want to undertake any work. You want to give rest to your body. Ultimately the body will come to an end by the passing of time. Show the courage to stick to the qualities on the basis of which Lord lived his life. Dont burn your heart for the wordly worries.
Dont get let down by the wordly miseries. Show courage. Give up the mental stress. Lord is the protector. He wont forget you even if the whole world goes adverse to you.
Lord, who is the protector of the afflicted, welds a bow in his hand. Even the death shivers at the sight of Lord. Let us understand the truth.
Lord protects them who abide by his qualities.
He who works for the noble cause need not worry about the enemies in the world. 
On the basis of wisdom, organisation skills and resource base in the form of armoury etc. Lord released Gods from the prison of Ravana. Lord is fondly remembered by Shiv and Parvati. 
The touch of Rama's feet to a rock brought back to life the wife of Rishi Gautam. Even the Vedas are not able to comprehend him. 
The Laws of Nature and the objects of Nature find their support in Lord. He granted boon of immortality to Hanuman and Bhibhishana.
Never disregard Lord. It is very difficult for human-beings to abide by his qualities. Wonderful are the results for those who abide by his qualities. The Puranas stand testimony to this fact.
You see God in the same form as that you have in your mind. Those who are fully devoted to Lord are protected by him.
God is always looking at you. Have the courage and see him. He will give you happiness and salvation.
The darkness cannot sustain after rising of Sun. Similarly wordly troubles disappear after seeing Lord.
Let us pray to our mind to always remain devoted to Lord.
Lord is the subject matter of Vedas and Puranas. He is the objective of the penance of Yogis. Give to Him all uneasiness of your mind. Let your mind always dwell on Lord.
Your mind is entangled in the false imaginations. Cause a change in the state of your mind through the power of discrimination.
Dont wander your mind too much. There wont be any happiness after that. The mind will get tired. Let us understand at the level of our conscious that our mind should rest at the feet of Lord. 
After having said many times. listen again that do everything so that Lord will give you place at his feet. 
Hold it firmly in your mind. Let us do good to us. While speaking let our mind dwell on the truth. Let our mind always dwell on Lord. 
When we are amidst people, we should keep quiet. We should always tell stories glorifying Lord. If at any place people are not taking interest in Lord then we should leave that place.
 We should learn to undergo hardships for the sake of happiness.
The persons whose company make us to lose balance of our mind,The company of persons that raises our ego, Let there be no such company that detach us from Lord. The moment that is gone without Lord is a loss. Such moments devoid of Lord make us feel tired. Let us always be focused and alert.
Our eyes should see the truth. Let us be alert and devoted while working with the people. We should build the resource base for doing work of public good. We should do our work systematically and sequentially. He who works like this is worth for living.
Our body should wear out for the cause of others. We should speak the truth. In whatever situation we are in, we should deal in the best interest of everyone concerned.
 We should implement what we say. Let us understand the real truth out of its different shades. Let us always abide by the good qualities and let us not be confused.
Our mind should not be full of desires and weaknesses. Let our mind undertake the penance. Let us be aloof from whatever conditions arise. Let us understand the all-pervading Brahma present everywhere. Let us purify our mind. Let all darkness be dispelled.
A mind that is intoxicated and jealous cannot understand the good course of action. Therefore let us show the exit route to intoxication, jealousy and selfishness. Let us speak politely.
Let us spend time for understanding the truth. Let us not indulge in discussions and debates to prove our intelligence. Let us make others happy and try to realise the all-pervading Brahma.
 Let us be polite to all. Let our behaviour be such that we are liked by all. Let us speak the truth and let us have a sound power of discrimination. Let us not speak rubbish.
Let us undertake hardships when our body is strong. Let us not be carried away with the wild imaginations. Let the determination of our mind be strong.
Let there be no useless and ugly cravings in our mind. Let our mind be full of love. God is kind to become indebted to his devotees for their devotion to him.
Let us be kind to the afflicted. Let our mind have love and care for others. Let our mind be free from anger and irritation.
Let us meditate on the truth to justify our existence. Let us always be devoted to the good work. Let us treat others at par with us i.e. let us understand that we are also governed by the same laws of nature as others are. Let us keep our mind free from impurities.
Let our mind not crave for sensual enjoyments. Let us understand that craving for sensual pleasures is due to the sins commited in the past. Let our mind always dwell on Lord. Let us not indulge in futile imaginations even for a while.
Our imaginations have no end. But our imaginations will not lead us to the truth. If our mind is not dwelling on Lord, how can we have love and respect for him?
Lord is the wish-yielding tree. He is the wish-yielding cow. He can relieve us of all our sorrows. He symbolises the truth. Let us understand that the world rests on him. None is comparable to Lord.
You are standing under the wish-yielding tree and you are sad. Let us realise Lord who is residing within us. Let us spread this theory of 'Ram is everywhere' amidst people. If we dont do this then we will feel sad in the future.
We have forgotten our true self. We are intoxicated and therefore we feel sad. We are confused between happiness and sensual pleasures. We are so sad that we are losing determination of our mind.
We have a wish-yielding cow at our home and we are begging for butter-milk. Our mind is not dwelling on Lord. Our mind is busy in raking up debates. Let us not break a ' sorrow removing gem ' for the sake of many pieces of glass.
A foolish person cannot have any power of discrimination. He who is always after sensual pleasures cannot hold Lord in his heart. He who is greedy is bound to become sad. The one who is always after sensual pleasures is useless.
 Let us say no to the worthless existence devoid of devotion. He who is a fool is always two times sad. Let our mind have love and respect at the feet of Lord. Let us not long for money always.
Many things keep on happening around us. Let us try to find out the substance of such happenings. If our mind is made impure then we will not become peaceful and happy. Let us meditate on Lord.
Lord is the ocean of beauty and good qualities. He has a great courage. He is serious in his work. His performance is great. He protects his devotees in their distress. Let us remember Lord every morning.
Lord who is welding a bow in hand is very powerful. Even the terrible death shivers at his sight. We are petty in all regards. Let us remember Lord every morning.
Lord creates bliss and relieves sorrows. Let us join others for collective devotion to Lord. Let us shun bad action and jealousy.
Let us always meditate on Lord. Let us rise above the sensual pleasures. He who implements this concept is not affected by wordly troubles. Let us not be lazy.
Lord's Name can set right many deficiencies of our mind. We can follow the noble path if we remember Lord. Remembering Lord creates huge stock of merit for us.
If we cannot understand books then we should atleast remember Lord in our mind. What efforts are required for that? Don't entangle your mind in the day to day happenings.
He who undertake penance puts his body under stress. He who remembers Lord while doing penance is relieved of the stress. God Shiva always remembers Lord.
There are many obstacles in the path of realisation of God. He who has wealth can perform rituals and give donations. Let us remember the protector of the afflicted.
Whatever has been said is having ony one substance - Good Action. You can see it for yourself. Let us remove confusion from our mind.
If we are not in a postion to perform good acts, similarly if we cannot perform japas and tapas, but then also we can always remember Lord to start with.
Remembering Lord will turn our attachment for sensual pleasures into attachment for Good Work. We will understand that other living creatures are no different from us. All the pairs of opposites that we experience will come to an end. We should sing the stories of Lord. Our mind should have faith in him.
He who does not believe in Lord, everything goes adverse to him. Lord is the controller of all. He can grant salvation from the wordly troubles. Dont be unnecessarily sad about the happenings taking place around you.
Attachment to Lord is the origin of all good signs. Let us have attachment for Lord. Let us win over the attachment to the world. We keep on indulging in imaginations. We long for something that is not there and then become sad.
Let Shri Rama dwell in our mind. Let us sail smoothly through the ocean of wordly troubles. Let us destroy jealousy in our mind.
 Dont cease to remember Lord under any guise. Let us always understand our true self. The gist of the Vedas and Puranas is that one should remember Lord. Nothing is comparable to this.
If we remember others then we wont get the same satisfaction. But people dont understand this. God Shiva, who is the killer of cupid (kama) remembers Lord as a medicine for the poison that he has taken. We are absolutely nothing as compared to God Shiva.
God Shiva who has killed cupid always dwells his mind on Lord. He respectfully tells stories of Lord to Goddess Parvati. God Shiva remembers Lord after having all knowledge, detachment and power.
Vitthal holds God Shankar on his head. God Shankar dwells his mind on Lord. Therefore we should not forget Lord. Who else can save us at the time of death?
Those who strive for salvation find their solace in Lord. Goddess Gouri and God Har always remember him. Let us also remember him.
He who remembers Lord becomes peaceful. Come and experience this peace. If we dont do this then we will get tired. Lord is our abode and will relieve us of our sorrows.
He who remembers Lord cannot be selfish, he sticks to virtues and is patient. The devotees of Lord can kill cupid. This is how Hanuman has proved his worth.
Remembering Lord is wonderful. It is easy and free. The attachment to the world comes to an end on remembering Lord. Then what remains is the bliss.
Let us remember Lord while we are amidst people, while we take food. While doing so we should have full respect and apply all our resources for that purpose. Let us not eat for the sake of feeding stomach. We should eat with the purpose of having ability to undertake good work.
He who does not remember Lord is wasted.' How to remember Rama? ' is the subject matter of Vedas, Shastras and Puranas. This is what has been stated by Maharishi Vyas.
Dont get fed up of Shri Rama. We should remember him with full respect. There is no great effort required to remember Lord. We should always remember the spouse of Sita.
He who remembers Rama with full devotion drives away all impurities from his mind. Lord likes to stay in the mind of all who remember him. God Shiva fondly remembers him. 
God takes care of this world. He is worried about the world. What it takes of you to remember him.
God Shankar on becoming angry can reduce to ashes all the three worlds. He is peaceful due to remembering Lord. Goddess Parvati also remembers Lord. Thatswhy we should also remember him. 
A sinner Ajamila has his son's name as Rama. Therefore he remembers Lord while calling his son. Due to this he has attained salvation. A prostitute has her parrot's name as Rama. Therefore she remembers Lord. She has made a place for herself in Puranas due to this.
Pralhada, a great devotee of Lord was born in the house of demons. He always remembered Rama. His Father who was sinful could not like this. He (father) did not remember Lord as he was a demon.
He who cannot remember cannot find salvation. Such people raise their ego and undergo all troubles. Later they come to an unceremonious end. Therefore we should remember Shri Ram.
Lord made rocks float in the sea. He has granted salvation to many human beings. But there are some sinful people who are always confused. Such people cannot remember Ram.
In this world the most holy place is Kashi. He who dies in Kashi attains to salvation alongwith his ancestors. This is possible due to Lord Ram always being remembered in Kashi. God Shankar himself explains the benefit of remembering Rama. Such is its significance.
People do not maintain purity in their actions. They do not acquire any merit through their actions. They dont have any love for all. They do not remember Lord.
He who does not remember Lord goes to hell. All sorts of logic that start with confusion end up with hell. Therefore we should respectfully remember Lord. This results in purification of our mind.
One should be exceedingly polite. One should work for good cause. One should respectfully abide by the good qualities.
Let us always remember Lord. Let us have love at his feet. Let us not have any ego. Let us never long for other's wealth and wife.
All said and nothing done. Such behaviour brings shame to our mind. If we think anything we like then we are not going to realise God.
Let the conscience prevail over our mind and guide our actions. Let our actions be pure. Let us act on what we say. Let us not burn in the flames of wordly worries.
It is nice to perform the daily rituals. Let the conscience tame our mind when our mind derails from the track. Let us have pity and affection for all. Let us be full of devotion, love and peace.
Let us shun anger and desire. Let us purify our intellect in association with good people. Let us not be associated with useless and evil people. This is how one can attain salvation.
We can purfy our actions and work with devotion only when we work in the association of good people. If we do not have the courage to act then we should not talk. Let us shun futile debates and make fruitful disussions.
Let us not indulge in futile debates. Let us spread happiness through meaningful discussions. Let us shun sadness and irritation. Let us shun futile debates and make fruitful disussions.
A good disussion is one which puts an end to a debate. Let the conscience overpower the ego. Due to ego we indulge in debates and then lose balance of our mind.
We should speak the truth for the sake of benefit. We should understand the whole matter for the sake of benefit. We should not indulge in petty quarrels for the sake of benefit.
The whole life is gone in telling others and in listeneing to others. But petty quarrels are still outsanding. When we get confused while arguing then we should understand that we are wrong.
 The learned people work against their interest when they work under the influence of ego. It is very difficult to find more learned people than who are referred to earlier. Therefore let us shun the ego.
Of what use are the blank words? Due to this in the course of time our ego rises. There is no meaning to our words if we cannot perform. He who thinks over it will understand quickly.
We should make discussions to end the ongoing debates. We should change our egoistic attitude under the influence of conscience. Whatever we tell others to do, let us do first. Let us change our course of action and follow the path of devotion.
Lord has suffered the pangs of transmigration for the sake of his devotee, Ambarishi. Lord has given Upamanyu, a devotee, a place in his abode. Lord never neglects his devotees.
Dhruva child was five years of age. The Lord immediately attended to his call and granted him a permanant postion in the space as a North Star.
Lord hurried to help out an elephant whose leg was caught by a crocodile in water. The reason was a call given by the elephant to the Lord.
The sinner Ajamila at the time of his death remembered Lord. The reason being his child was also having Rama as his name. The merciful Lord granted salvation to him. Lord supports everyone who does not have any support.
For the sake of protection of earth he took the form of a fish, a tortoise at some points of time. He does not mind taking a form of a creature of low breed for the good of people at large.
 Lord acquired a form of a Lion God ( Narsimha) for protecting his devotee (Pralhada) .
He became Waman for the sake of Indra. He descended to earth as Parshurama for the protection of the intellectual class.
Lord set free Ahilya who became a rock following a curse of her husband. Lord also freed Gods from the shackles of Ravana.
The Lord rushed for help leaving aside all matters when a call was made to him by Droupadi. The Lord has descended as Goutam Buddha for the benefit of people in the Kali Age.
 Lord takes birth on this earth for the protection of the afflicted. Vedas are unable to comprehend him.
Lord descends to this earth in many forms for the sake of the good of the people at large. People who do not understand him are sinners, evil and gone cases.
He is worth living who experiences the bliss of Lord's existence. He is worth living who listens to the stories of Lord. He is worth living who has raised his concious from the level of his body to reach the level of Lord. He is worth living who has merged all his desires in Lord.
Let our mind dwell on Lord. Let us shun selfishness. Let us not indulge in evil designs. Let us honestly remain in the association of the honest people.
Let us remain in the company of honest people for the sake of better tommorrow. Good thoughts can trasform an evil person. He who always likes sensual pleasures is a gone case. Let us learn to rise above the temperament of the moment.
Dont plan rubbish. Let the mind always dwell on the truth. Let us stop babbling amidst people. Let us hold Lord in our mind always.
Lord does what he says. He works for the emancipation of the whole world. Let us understand and praise Lord. Let us hold the hero of Sita at the level of our conscience.
Lord acts after due meditation. He who has an agitated mind becomes calm after remembering Lord. Let us not speak without knowing the truth. Let our actions amidst people be pure and proportionate.
The devotee of Lord is detached from the world, he understands the truth and has a strong determination. Our stock of merit rise if we see such devotee. If we talk with him then our confusion ends.
A true devotee is free from greed, passion and misery.
Let us have association with good people. This will render change in our way of thinking. This will purify our mind and intellect. This will help us attain salvation and win over the death.
Everyone in this world is shivering with fear. The good people who can see the truth do not have fear. Let us find him who will end our state of separation. Let us find him who will remove fear from our mind. 
The great people have told the truth in very clear terms. Still we cannot understand. We cannot raise our conscious beyond our body. We cannot see the truth due to the ego we have. 
We have lost the treasure due to our delusion. Now we are rendered poor. He who cannot raise his conscious beyond his body cannot see the truth. 
We cannot see the wealth hidden all around. We cannot see the truth. If we do not have faith then we cannot earn any merit. 
We are not able to get back to the state we have lost. We are entangled here and there. Our mind is not capable of getting out of delusion.
We should offer us to the service of the wise person who knows the truth. We should grasp his feet. We cannot see unless an enlightened person guides us. 
We are not capable of understanding the truth. We are not capable of experiencing the truth. We are not capable of dispelling confusion from our mind. We are not capable to renounce our ego. It appears that it is beyond our power to understand Lord. 
We cannot understand due to delusion. We are confused and unable to decide our interest. We have accepted the currency notes without verifying the validity. 
What is the truth? Let us explore in the world. Let us find out with the full devotion of mind. If we move in this manner then we will realise God. This way we will do away with all our ignorance and confusion.
We are always concerned about the sensual pleasures. Ego and ignorance is rising in our mind. Let us tame our mind with conscience. Let us understand our true self. 
What appears to our eyes is not the truth. We are nursing our body with great care but death may destroy it any moment. Let us try to find out the infinite and all-pervading truth. 
That element which cannot break or move is there. That is there but we stand separated from that due to our ego. Let us drive out this ego from our mind. 
This element is formless. It is the support for Brahmas and others. This element cannot be comprehended by Vedas. Let us reach out that element on the basis of conscience.
We cannot see the all-pervading element with our eyes. We can see it through the eyes of knowledge. When we see that element then we lose our existence. 
That element is neither yellow nor white nor black. It niether appears nor has it disappeared. Let us find that element. Let us attain to the state of eternal bliss. 
Let us find the truth. Let our mind experience the truth. All this is possible through association with good people. Let us have a strong determination and let us focus on our purpose. 
We may impress others through effective speaking. But let us understand the truth. The gist of the truth is good action. Let us have courage to act honestly.
Our mind cannot become stable after learning physics, chemistry, philosophy and other such sciences in isolation. Niether can undertaking penance or renunciation can make it stable. The mind becomes stable only in the association with good people. 
The great mantras, the great philosophies, everything we can understand in association with the good people. They tell us their experience and guide our way. 
Let us try to find out the element that is invisible. There lies the secret. We cannot just hold it exclusively with us. That element is all-pervading. 
He who calls himself a learned person is a fool. The element that we have been talking about is beyond logic. So no one can explain it logically. One who does not have any ego can realise that element. The moment that element is realised, the identity of the person who realises gets merged with that element.
There is no benefit in reading lot of books. This may affect our determination. Our mind may go against the Shastras if our mind becomes agumentative after reading a lot. This will hamper our progress of self-realisation. 
Shrutis, Laws, Mimansas, Shastras, Smrities, Vedas are very difficult for one to understand. Even the great Shesh who is the seat of God Vishnu shuts his thousand mouths and maintains silence on this matter. Therefore likes of us do not have any scope for ego. 
A person is eating a very delicious food. With the last morcel he eats a fly. All the good taste of the meals is now gone. Similarly one who is egoistic cannot have any knowledge. 
Let us not indulge in debates that make us feel sad. Let us not have the habbit of useless analysis and hair-splitting. What to teach others when we have ego with us.
Ego causes all sorrows. Ego renders all knowledge useless. A peaceful mind is the abode of bliss. Let us realise our true self. 
He who is egoist does not abide by ethics. He may earn a name amidst people. But his mind experiences uneasiness. He who has ego does not accept any evidence against his opinion. 
He who is entangled in sensual pleasures loses his larger interest. Our conscious should not be at the level of our body. It should be at the level of truth. 
Let us free our mind from the tangle of sensual pleasures. Let us understand the all-pervading God. Let us shun false imaginations. Let us have assciation with good people.
One who indulges in sensual pleasures keeps his mind after senses. Let us attain salvation by dwelling our mind on Shri Hari. 
In the begining one is concerned about himself. Later he is concerned about wife and children. Let us come out of such worries. Let us have association with good people. 
Let our determination rest on the ever-lasting spirit. Let us stop getting confused. Let us put every moment of our life to good use. 
He is good who is good at heart and who does not yield to bad ideas. If we praise someone then his ego rises. If we praise a good person he is not affected.
Let us take refuge at the feet of a good preceptor for knowing the infinite spirit. Let us not expand our ego. Let us dwell on the eternal spirit in our mind. Let us not go after sensual pleasures. 
Let us have the knowledge that will end our attachment to sensual pleasures. Let us deal with everything with conscience. The mind becomes restless when it dwells on the sensual pleasures. Let us understand our true self. 
If we do not undertake the good work then we cannot realise the eternal spirit. We cannot look at the eternal spirit with our eyes. One can never realise the eternal spirit who has ego in mind. 
He who goes after the sensual pleasures is ignorant. He who has knowledge realises the eternal spirit. Let us try to realise our true self.
Ego is what has separated us from the eternal spirit. Ego is the cause for craving for sensual pleasures. Let us think on this point. 
The truth cannot be seen with our eyes. If we run after sensual pleasures then who can protect us? One who is merciful observes whatever happens and is never involved in the happenings. 
God Brahma writes destiny of each and every one on their forehead. But who writes the destiny of God Brahma on his forehead. God Har destroys everything at the end. But who is the destination of God Har? 
Similarly there are other Gods who are assigned their responsibilites. Now how should we decide who is the best God?
The eternal spirit remains in the place forever. The spirit cannot be seen with the eyes. 
People worship the God whom they like. But they do not try to find out the truth. There are crores of Gods that are worshipped in this world. Everone thinks that his devotion to the God is the best one. 
Let us try to realise that God who has created all the three worlds. This greatest God is not visible without taking refuge at the feet of the preceptor. 
There are crores of preceptors in this world. They know many mantras and weld tremendous power. They have desires and cravings in their mind. They are of no use. They cannot take their disciples to the state of salvation.
A preceptor should not indulge in gimmicks. He should not be after money. He should not abuse others. He should not have jealousy for others. He should not be intoxicated with addiction of any sort. He should not be like what we have said earlier. He should have a good and indepth knowledge. He should not indulge in spreading sparks of discontent here and there. 
He should not just speak everything and do nothing. He who acts on his words is a good preceptor. We should take refuge at the feet of such preceptor. 
He should have knowledge, conscience and detachment for the world. He should be kind hearted, forgiving and he should control his mind. He should gauge the depth of his disciples. If we take refuge at the feet of such preceptor then we can get satisfaction. 
Now we are at the feet of a good preceptor. Now we can realise the infinite truth.
Let us hide in the abode of Lord. There are no fears and worries over there. The abode of Lord can be experienced though it is not visible to eyes.
Lord is always standing near us. Let us see the truth. Let us unite with Lord forever. Let us shun ego that keeps us in separation from Lord. 
All the living beings are actually one with the Supreme Being. But that is not what our identity is. Let us observe whatever comes to our experience. Let us not get involved and be happy. 
Let the knowledge remove conscious away from the sensual pleasures. Let us devote to the truth. Let us detach from the world. Let us shun everything condemned in the world. Let us not get involved. Let us observe whatever takes place.
Let us understand the God who has created the world. He who sees God becomes blissful. Even when the God is formless still we can see him taking forms. Let us maintain detachment and equanimity. 
God is above the creator and the creation. He does not get involved in anything. He is without any form. Let us dwell on him. Let us get detached from the world and let us be happy by maintaining equanimity of mind. 
He who has conscious at the level of sensual pleasures can never understand the truth. The eternal spirit cannot be experienced by him who has ego. If we think that everything is blank then this is our ignorance. 
We cannot understand him. He never changes. If we meditate on him then we merge in him. God's form cannot be explained by citing wordly examples.
He is beyond all consciousness. He cannot be understood. That does not mean that he is not there. He is neither visible nor invisible. He is observing all. When a discussion of God starts in Vedas, Vedas say that he is beyond all discussions. 
Where does the God reside in our mind. This is a question asked by a devotee. He wants to know where the God will reside when our body falls. At that time whether god will shift his place. 
God in our mind is as wide as the sky. He neither comes from anywhere nor goes to anywhere. He is always there. Nothing exists in this world without him. 
Whatever atoms and molecules are present everywhere there is no space without him. He who looks at him is merged with him. Now there is no scope for any differentiation.
Lord is like the sky. If we remeber him then we get detached from the world. Our conscious rises above the level of sensual pleasures after looking at him. There cannot be any separation from him thereafter. 
The sky covers the universe. Lord is all-pervading spirit. Therefore we cannot compare him with the sky. 
God is always in existence. He is boundless. He cannot be understood through logic. A preceptor can merge us with the God. 
He who realises Lord finds him in existence everywhere.
Now there is no relevance of 'I' and 'You'. A person who realises Lord sees him everywhere. 
We are told the secret about the God. But we should strive for realisation of God. Let us associate with good people to make our existence worthwhile. 
Let us have detachment for the world. Let us associate with good people with full honour. Good association will end our sorrows. Good association will keep us on the right track. 
Good association results in detachment from the world. Good association leads to salvation.
Let us remove impurities of our mind by listening to the verses for mind. Let us transform our conscious that is dull into an alert one. Let us gain knowledge, detachment to the world and ability of mind by listening to the verses for mind. Let us follow the royal path for attaining salvation.
